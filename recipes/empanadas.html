    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>The best thing about this recipe is that you can make them and, instead of cooking them right away, wrap them in the plastic that comes with the empanada dough and freeze them (although making them with homemade empanada dough is always the best option).</p>
    <p>This recipe is what you'd call a classic or a base recipe, as some might say. In other words, this meat empanada recipe is the most traditional one you’ll find.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For 12 empanadas:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 empanada doughs</li>
        <li>1/2 kg. of minced beef</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1/2 red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 tomato</li>
        <li>2 spoons of tomato paste</li>
        <li>Some olives</li>
        <li>Some sweet pepper powder</li>
        <li>Cumin</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Juicy and Delicious!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot with hot oil, add the onion and bell pepper. 
            Let them sauté for a few minutes, and when they’re halfway cooked (onion turning translucent), add the garlic along with a bit of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat and add all the ground meat at once. 
            Stir the meat to prevent it from sticking together. 
            Once the meat is browned, add the diced tomato and the 2 tablespoons of tomato paste. Season with paprika, cumin, and a bit more salt and pepper, then mix well. Cover the pot (leaving a small gap) and let it cook for about half an hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and let the filling cool in the pot. 
            Add the chopped olives and mix well. (At this step, you can add <em>anything</em> else you'd like: 
            hard-boiled eggs, raisins, potatoes, etc.)</li>
        <li>Divide the filling among the empanada dough discs and close them with a traditional crimped edge. 
            Before baking, you can brush them with egg if you like—this is optional.</li>
        <li>Place the meat empanadas on a baking tray and bake in a hot oven until golden brown. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
